# Intro

**Drupal YASnippet** is a collection of snippets for use with
[YASnippet](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet/ "YASnippet")
templating system for Emacs. These are not snippets for general PHP, CSS or
SASS use. They are only bits that make your life in Drupal eaiser.

## Why would I want snippets for Drupal?

I'm not a fan of snippets for trivial bits of code. I forget all the time to
use for<TAB> to make a for loop for instance. But everytime I need to implement
a hook, I find myself crusing over to Drupal.org to look up the hook
definition, what it returns and how to use it. These snippets take care of doing
most of that for me.

For instance, I type ````hook_node_view<TAB>```` and I have all of the args for
hook_node_view() already filled in.
````PHP
/**
 * Implements hook_node_view().
 *
 * TODO (msmith): Add documentation.
 */
function store_node_view($node, $view_mode, $langcode) {

}
````

It also promotes coding standards by ensuring you get approriate function level
documentation and TODO reminders to add more.


# Installation

Follow the instructions to install YASnippet:
https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet/blob/master/README.mdown

Clone this repository into your ~/.emacs.d directory:
````
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/vml-msmith/drupal-yasnippet.git
````

Add this line to your `.emacs` file *AFTER* the YASnippet bits:
````
(setq yas/root-directory "~/.emacs.d/drupal-yasnippet")
(yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)
````

Restart Emacs or reload your .emacs file:
````
M-x load-file
<RETURN>
~/.emacs.d/.emacs
````

You should now have Drupal YASnippets.

# Usage

## Invocation

From within a PHP-mode file (module, inc, install, php) just type the name of a
hook that is defined, and press tab.
````
hook_init<TAB>
````

The default template will be spit out for you ready for input.


## Standards

These snippets try to follow Drupal's coding standards where appropriate.
Every snippet that creates a function will be prepended with /** **/
documentation, for example.````hook_node_view```` will spit this out...

````PHP
/**
 * Implements hook_node_view().
 *
 * TODO (msmith): Add documentation.
 */
function store_node_view($node, $view_mode, $langcode) {

}
````

Notice the ````Implements hook_node_view().```` before the actual function
definition.

Also notice that the function name is ````store_node_view````. This is because
I invoked hook_node_view from inside a file named store.module. The snippets
are smart enough to detect your module name and fill that part in for you.

One last thing. Most methods and hooks in this bundle will add a
''''TODO (your_user_name): Add documentation'''' somewhere. This is in an effort
to promote adding documentation to everything you write.
